# Coin Toss

This Bash script simulates a simple coin toss. 

**How it Works:**

The script utilizes a random number generator to simulate the flipping of a coin. You are prompted to choose "heads (h)" or "tails (t)". The script then randomly determines the outcome ("heads" or "tails") and displays the result.

**How to Use:**

1. **Save the script:** Save the code below as a file named `coin_toss.sh`.

2. **Make it executable:** Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then, execute the following command to make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x coin_toss.sh
   ```
3. Run the script: Execute the script by typing the following command in your terminal:
```Bash
./coin_toss.sh
```

4. **Follow the prompts**: The script will ask you to choose "heads (h)" or "tails (t)". Enter your choice and press Enter.

5. **View the result**: The script will display the outcome of the coin toss ("heads" or "tails") and let you know if your guess was correct.
