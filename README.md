# Simple Coin Flip Script

This Bash script simulates a single coin flip and displays the result (Heads or Tails).  This is a small, fun project.

## Usage

1. Save the script to a file `coin_toss.sh`.
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x coin_toss.sh`
3. Run the script: `./coin_toss.sh`

The script will output the result of the coin flip.

## Example
```bash
Flipping...
The coin landed on: HEADS
```
